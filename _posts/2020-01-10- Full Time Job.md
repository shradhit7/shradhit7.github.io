Hi, this is my second post on my blog! :) 

Some life updates - I’m done with my Masters at Rutgers in 1.5 years (yey!) & completed the Data Scientist (internship ) at Veritonic Inc, successfully - for around 6 - 7 months. I loved my work in music information retrieval, audio intelligence and NLP. [Kevin](https://falicon.com/) ( CTO - Veritonic ) & Andrew ( COO - Veritonic) found my work interesting, and I’m glad that I could contribute to a brilliant startup like Veritonic. I got a chance to meet many amazing people in Veritonic though [Jeff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyspiro/) ( Head of Marketing also wittiest, smart & funny guy ), [Matt](https://www.mattgagliano.com/) ( Head of Products & science / tech geek ) and [Rich](https://www.richinfante.com/) ( Software Developer and coding genius ) made the work feel less like work, their passion is unparalleled and super inspirational. I will also remember what Matt said, “Ask a person, what he likes to do in his free time / projects he is working on the side “ and his enthusiasm, will be enough to tell you if he is the right person for the job. 

Having some experience of startups, I wanted to get a taste of mid / big size firms thus I accepted a full time employment offer from [ZS Associates](https://www.zs.com/) ( New York City ), for the position of Data Science Associate (basically a data scientist). Now I’ve got some time (till the start of my job ) to reflect back thinking about the mindset that led me to adopt habits, I suppose were right to be a better data scientist at Veritonic and crack interview at ZS Associates. There are many things I learned / understood / experienced as an international student applying for jobs and during the perparation for interviews. I’ll give my perspective on that (wrt Data Science) and mention hacks and tricks to be a better data scientist!


**Breif about ZS Interview** : Resume Shortlist, call from the hiring manager & after somedays call from a Consultant or Manager.If things go positive then - On-site interview for ~ 5 hours ( i know, its loads! ). 


### Hacks to be a better Data Scientist 

- Code, code, code - practice makes perfect, right? 
- Don't try to be jack of all trade, master of none! Choose the domains(in DS) you find intersting and be an expert in that!  
- thorough understanding of machine learning theory 
- Math is Important ( specifically statistics and linear algebra ) - _let no one say you anything otherwise_ 
- Database - SQL & MongoDB ( never ignore databases) 
- Hands on working with data engineeing tools ( AWS, GCP, Docker etc. ) 
- Developing a problem solving attitude
- Keep Learning

I'll be starting to work at ZS Associates by first week of Febuary and the next blog post will be related to that!
_Cheers :)__

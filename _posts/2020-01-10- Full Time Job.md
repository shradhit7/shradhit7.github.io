Hi, this is my second post on my blog! Some life updates -  I'm done with my Masters at Rutgers in 1.5 years (yey!) & the Data Scientist (internship ) at Veritonic Inc, _successfully_ - which lasted for summer & fall semester ( around 6 - 7 months ). I loved my work in Music Information Retrieval, Audio Intelligence and NLP. Kevin (CTO - Veritonic) & Andrew ( COO - Veritonic) found my work intresting. Met Jeff ( Marketing Head ) - one of the most witty, smart & funny person also tech / science geeks including Matt ( Head of Products ) and Rich (software Developer). 
Having some experience of startups, my proclivities  towards the big firms thus I accepted an offer for full time employment from ZS Associates (New York City), for the position of Data Science Associate (basically a data scientist). 
I've got sometime to reflect back about the mindset that led to the habits, I think were right to be a data scientist at Veritonic also also crack interview at ZS Associates. There are many things you learn / understand / experience as an international students applying for jobs, the interview process and the preparation for the interviews in general - I'll  give my perspective on that wrt Data Science also mention hacks and tricks to be a better data scientist!  

## Be a better Data Scientist :

Breif about ZS Interview : Resume Shortlist, call from the hiring manager & after somedays call from a Consultant or Manager.If things go positive then - On-site interview for ~5 hours.

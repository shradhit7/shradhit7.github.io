Hi, this is my second post on my blog! :) 

Some life updates - I’m done with my Masters at Rutgers in 1.5 years (yey!) & completed the Data Scientist (internship ) at Veritonic Inc, successfully - which lasted from summer till the end of fall semester ( around 6 - 7 months ). I loved my work in Music Information Retrieval, Audio Intelligence and NLP. [Kevin](https://falicon.com/)(CTO - Veritonic) & Andrew( COO - Veritonic) found my work interesting, and I’m glad that I could contribute to a brilliant startup like Veritonic. I got a chance to meet one of the most witty, smart & funny guy - [Jeff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyspiro/)( Head of Marketing ) and science / tech geeks - [Matt](https://www.mattgagliano.com/) ( Head of Products ) and [Rich](https://www.richinfante.com/)( Software Developer ) they made the work feel less like work, their passion is unparalleled and super inspirational. Matt says, “Ask a person what he does in his free time / projects he is working on the side “ and his enthusiasm, will be enough to tell you if you are hiring a right person.\

Having some experience of startups, I wanted to get a taste of mid size / big firms thus I accepted a full time employment offer from ZS Associates (New York City), for the position of Data Science Associate (basically a data scientist). Now I’ve got some time to reflect back about the mindset that led me to adopt habits, I suppose were right to be a better data scientist at Veritonic and crack interview at ZS Associates. There are many things I learned / understood / experienced as an international students applying for jobs, during the perparation of interview. I’ll give my perspective on that (wrt Data Science) and mention hacks and tricks to be a better data scientist!\\


**Breif about ZS Interview** : Resume Shortlist, call from the hiring manager & after somedays call from a Consultant or Manager.If things go positive then - On-site interview for ~5 hours. 


### Hacks to be a better Data Scientist 

- Code, code, code - practice makes perfect, right? 
- Don't try to be jack of all trade, master of none! Choose the domains you find intersting and be an expert in that!  
- Machine Learning Theory 
- Math is Important - let no one say you anything otherwise. 
- Statistics and Linear Algebra  
- Database - SQL & MongoDB ( never ignore databases) 
- Data Engineeing ( AWS, GCP, Docker etc. ) 
- Developing a problem solving attitude
- Keep Learning\\

I'll be starting to work at ZS Associates by first week of Febuary and the next blog post will be related to that! Cheers :)

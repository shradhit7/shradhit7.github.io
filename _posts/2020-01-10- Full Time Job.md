Hi, this is my second post on my blog! Some life updates -  I'm done with my Masters at Rutgers in 1.5 years (yey!) & completed the Data Scientist (internship ) at Veritonic Inc, _successfully_ - which lasted from summer till the end of fall semester ( around 6 - 7 months ). I loved my work in Music Information Retrieval, Audio Intelligence and NLP. Kevin (CTO - Veritonic) & Andrew ( COO - Veritonic) found my work intresting, and I'm glad that I could contribute to a brilliant startup like Veritonic. I got a chance to meet one of the most witty, smart & funny guy - Jeff ( Head of Marketing ) and science / tech geeks - Matt ( Head of Products ) and Rich ( Software Developer ) they made the work feel less like work, their passion is unparalleled and super inspirational.  Matt says, "Ask a person what he does in his free time / projects he is working on the side " amd see with what enthusiasm he answers, that will basically tell you if you are hiring a right person of the job. 

Having some experience of startups, I wanted to get a taste of mid size / big firms thus I accepted an full time employment offer from ZS Associates (New York City), for the position of Data Science Associate (basically a data scientist). 
I've got sometime to reflect back about the mindset that led to the habits, I think were right to be a data scientist at Veritonic also also crack interview at ZS Associates. There are many things you learn / understand / experience as an international students applying for jobs, the interview process and the preparation for the interviews in general - I'll  give my perspective on that wrt Data Science also mention hacks and tricks to be a better data scientist!  

## Be a better Data Scientist : 

### Hacks to be a better Data Scientist 

- Code, code, code - practice makes perfect, right? 
- Machine Learning Theory 
- Math is Important - let no one say you anything otherwise. 
- Statistics and Linear Algebra  
- Database - SQL & MongoDB ( never ignore databases) 
- Data Engineeing ( AWS, GCP, Docker etc. ) 
- Developing a problem solving attitude
- Keep Learning 

### Domains
Many sub domains in Data Science. The once I worked on includes -

- Audio Processing / Intelligence  
- Natural Langauge Processing / Generation
- Image Segmentation / Classification 
- Recommenadation Engine 
- Analytics 

Breif about ZS Interview : Resume Shortlist, call from the hiring manager & after somedays call from a Consultant or Manager.If things go positive then - On-site interview for ~5 hours. 
I'll be starting to work at ZS Associates by first week of Febuary and the next blog post will be related to that! Cheers :)

title: Full Time at ZS Associates 
---

Hi, this is my second post on my blog! Some life updates -  I'm done with the Data Scientist (internship ) at Veritonic Inc. which lasted for summer & fall semister ( around 6 - 7 months ) & accepted an offer for full time employment from ZS Associates (New York City), for the position of Data Science Associate (basically a data scientist). 
I've got sometime to reflect back about the mindset that led to habits, I think were right to be a data scientist. There are many things you learn / understand / experience as an international students applying for jobs, the interview process and the preparation for the interviews in general - I'll like to give my perspective on that wrt Data Science. I'll also mention some hacks and tricks to be a better data scientist!  


- Code, code, code - practice makes perfect, right ? 
- Math is Important - let no one say you anything otherwise. 
- Databases - SQL & NoSQL
- Keep Learning


I'll try to write in brief about the interview process! 
- what does ZS Associates do? 
ZS is a professional services firm that helps companies develop and deliver products for their customers. Our experts work side by side with clients, leveraging analytics, technology and strategy to create solutions that work in the real world.

---

Hi, this is my second post on my blog! Some life updates -  I'm done with the Data Scientist (internship ) at Veritonic Inc. which lasted for summer & fall semester ( around 6 - 7 months ) & accepted an offer for full time employment from ZS Associates (New York City), for the position of Data Science Associate (basically a data scientist). 
I've got sometime to reflect back about the mindset that led to habits, I think were right to be a data scientist. There are many things you learn / understand / experience as an international students applying for jobs, the interview process and the preparation for the interviews in general - I'll like to give my perspective on that wrt Data Science. I'll also mention some hacks and tricks to be a better data scientist!  

### Hacks to be a better Data Scientist 

- Code, code, code - practice makes perfect, right ? 
- Database - SQL & No SQL ( never ignore databases) 
- Machine Learning Theory

- Data Engineeing ( AWS, GCP, Docker etc. ) 
- Developing a problem solving attitude

### Domains

I'll try to write in brief about the interview process!

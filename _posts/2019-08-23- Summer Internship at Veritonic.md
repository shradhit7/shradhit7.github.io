title: Summer Internship at Veritonic
---

Hey, I'm Shradhit Subudhi & this is my first post over my website <http://www.shradhit.com>.
Right now, I'm done with my internship at Veritonic - a dynamic startup which measures and scores audio creative, including voice, sonic brand elements and music — in streaming and radio ads, podcasts, smart speaker applications etc.
This post is about my work and experiences, I had a privilege to gather during my ten weeks of internship at Veritonic. I'll attempt to elaborate on the things I understood about startup culture & dealing with people from my mentor / boss [Kevin Marshall](https://falicon.com) ( Chief Technical Officer [CTO] - Veritonic ).

### Let's get started :

After my fall'18 semester i.e. during December, I'd been applying to various firms for internship. Done with my undergrad in computer science at College of Engineering Pune - India, I had been majoring in Data Analytics at Rutgers University, New Jersey - America. Having an innate interest in mathematics, statistics and machine learning, I was looking for Data Analyst / Scientist positions. Applications to firms seemed like an endless process. By January, many firms did revert back some positively, many negatively - one of best was Veritonic.

Andrew Eisner ( Chief Operating Officer [COO] - Veritonic ) asked me to forward a writeup regarding the work that I've done in the past in the field of Data Science. On the basis of that, I was invited for a telephonic interview. Prolly they liked my experience, cause eventually they called me for an in-person interview where I got a chance to meet Kevin Marshall and Andrew Eisner. Kevin was a tech genius and Andrew looked into all the administration. Andrew is a Harvard Graduate so, is Harvey Specter, Louis Litt & Frank Underwood thus I was excited to meet a Harvard Graduate in real life. All I can say after meeting him is Suits & House of Cards do not inflate or exaggerate their skillset.

Regarding their position in the firm they were humble. I wish to inculcate their humility. Things went fine and I was selected to be a Data Scientist at Veritonic for summer '19. Will never forget that day, really fortunate that I was selected.

### Work in veritonic :

There were two projects I worked in ten weeks both were related to audio data :
-  gender classification over audio files (.mp3 or .wav file) i.e. detect if the person talking is a male / female. Also distinguish audio among human voice & music.   
-  emotion predictions over audio files (.mp3 or .wav file) detect if the person talking is making the listener enthusiastic, happy, inspired etc.

### Things I learned :

- We should not reinvent the wheels, why?

Reinventing the wheel is a practice of unnecessarily engineering artifacts that provide functionality already provided by existing standard artifacts and ending up with a worse result than the standard. Before starting the problem statement, there has to be a rigorous literature survey about similar projects made by researchers expert in the respective field, it gives us an idea about the industry standards.


-  Startup Culture, what is that ?

In a startup environment a person has to wear multiple hats. For example : [Rich Infante](https://www.richinfante.com), being a software developer at Veritonic (also a good friend) was working towards data analytics projects. Startup culture -  values creative problem solving, open communication and flat hierarchy.

- Humility is important, cause..

I could witness the CXOs (includes CEO, COO and CTO) dictates the primary values in the firm. In Veritonic, CXOs are down to earth and approachable. I could express my ideas about the project and Kevin would always encourage me in trying out that approach & allot me resources towards the same. He (Kevin) would always talk to us about the business point of view of the product, which we are building. That would help us understand, the thought process of the client using our data science innovations.

- Coding is important, so is commenting..

Emphasis is made on making the code more readable when it is being used in the production. It should be understood by anyone who reads it with ease so that it can be modified (by anyone) whenever necessary.


- Defining characteristics of American Culture, are ..

   - Equality - The American Declaration of Independence states that “all [people] are created equal,” and this belief is deeply embedded in their cultural values. Americans believe that all people are of equal standing, and are therefore uncomfortable with overt displays of respect such as being bowed to.

   - Informality - This belief in equality causes Americans to be rather informal in their behavior towards other people. Don’t be surprised if store clerks and waiters introduce themselves by their first names. Many people visiting the US are surprised by the informality of American speech, dress, and posture. Don’t mistake this for rudeness or irreverence; it’s just a part of their culture!

   - Directness -  Americans tend to value, frankness and openness in their dealings with other people. They believe that conflicts and disagreements are best solved by means of forthright discussion among the people involved. Americans believe that if someone has a problem with someone else, they should tell the person clearly and directly in order to come up with a solution to the problem.
